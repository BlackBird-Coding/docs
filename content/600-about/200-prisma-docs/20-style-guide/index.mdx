This guide contains guidelines for contributors to the Prisma docs. Its goal is to ensure consistency throughout the Prisma docs and with other official Prisma materials.

## Boilerplate

The following section contains frequently used phrases or blocks of content that you can re-use:

### To introduce a preview feature

````md
To enable this feature, add `namedConstraints` to `previewFeatures` in your schema:

```prisma highlight=3;normal
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["namedConstraints"]
}
```
````

### Making recommendations

If it is a Prisma recommendation, use:

> "**We recommend that** you share a single instance of `PrismaClient` across your application."

If it is an industry standard, use:

> "**It is recommended practice to** limit the number of database connections to X."
