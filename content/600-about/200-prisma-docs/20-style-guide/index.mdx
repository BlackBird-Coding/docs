<TopBlock>

Welcome! This guide contains information for writing and maintaining technical documentation for the Prisma tools. One major goal of this style guide is to ensure consistency in the Prisma documentation with respect to things like word choice, writing style, formatting and more.

> **This style guide is heavily inspired by the [Gatsby Style Guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/).** Many sections have been bluntly copied, some others have been slightly edited and some are new and specific to the Prisma docs.

</TopBlock>

## Word choice

### Audience

Write for an audience that has basic coding experience. Assume that they know how to use their development tools, but do not assume that they know complex software development and database concepts.

### Write in US English

Use US English punctuation, grammar, and spelling. For example:

- "color" over "colour"
- "behavior" over "behaviour"

### Write in the second person

Any content should use the second person ("you") to provide a conversational tone. Second-person text and instructions speak directly to the person reading it. Avoid the first person ("I", "we", "let's", and "us").

"You" in documentation is also more accurate than "we" because typically only one person is reading the docs at a time and the person who wrote the tutorial is not actually going through it with them, so "we" is inaccurate.

#### When to use "we"

You can use "we" when specifically referring to Prisma. For example:

> "We recommend that you share a single instance of `PrismaClient` across your application.

### Avoid words like "easy" and "just"

Avoid using words like "easy", "just" "simple" and "basic" because if users have a hard time completing the task that is supposedly "easy," they will question their abilities. Consider using more specific descriptors; for example, when you say the phrase "deployment is easy," what do you really mean? Is it easy because it takes fewer steps than another option? If so, use the most specific descriptor possible, which in that case would be "this deployment method involves fewer steps than other options."

For even more inclusive docs, avoid phrases that assume a reader’s experience or skill level, like "just deploy it and you’re done" or "for a refresher (referring to a completely different doc that someone may not have read)". Often, rephrasing results in stronger sentences that appeal to a wider range of contexts.

### Use inclusive language

When you refer to one or more people in the third person, use inclusive, gender-neutral language. Use "they/them/their" instead of "he/him/his" or "she/her/her". Avoid gender-specific words like "guys".

### Avoid emojis, slang, and metaphors

Avoid using emojis or emotions in the docs and idiomatic expressions, slang, or metaphors. Prisma has a global community, and the cultural meaning of an emoji, emoticon, or slang may be different around the world. Use your best judgment! Also, emojis can render differently on different systems.

### Avoid Latin terms

For example:

- et al
- etc.
- i.e.
- e.g.

### Avoid contractions

For example:

- You're (use "You are")
- It'll (use "It will")

### Define jargon

Write in short, clear sentences, and use as little jargon as necessary.

> Jargon: (n.) special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand.

Use the following guidelines for jargon:

- If the jargon is specific to Prisma, then link to a definition in our docs.

  Only do this on the first instance of a term in a logical section of the docs. A logical section is a unit that someone would likely read at one time. Typically, it is a page, or a section of a page.

- For terms not specific to Prisma, do not explain or link to the definition if it can be found by quickly Googling.

- Otherwise, link to an external page. Ensure that is a credible source, such as official database provider documentation or Wikipedia.

### Referring to other parts of the docs

- Page
- Section

### Technical word choice

#### Record

Refer to rows in the database as **records**. For example:

"The following `create` query creates a single `User` **record**."

Do not use:

- Entry
- Row
- Object

#### Model property

Model property refers to the top-level `PrismaClient` properties that refer to models:

```
const result = await prisma.user.findMany(...) // user model property
const result = await prisma.post.findMany(...) // post model property
```

## Writing style

### Write concisely and avoid long blocks of text

Concise writing communicates the bare minimum without redundancy. Strive to make your writing as short as possible; this practice will often lead to more accurate and specific writing. To avoid large blocks of text:

- Use shorter paragraphs
- Use lists
- Use examples
- Use bold and emphasis
- Use tables
- Use diagrams

### Use active voice

Use active voice instead of passive voice. Generally, it’s a more concise and straightforward way to communicate a subject. For example:

- (passive) The for loop in JavaScript is used by programmers to…
- (active) Programmers use the for loop in JavaScript to…

When our software or third-party does something, state which module or component carries out the action, if it's important to the user.

- "Prisma Client returns all `DateTime` as ISO 8601-formatted strings."

Where the module or component is not important to the user, say that Prisma (or the name of the third-party software) carries out the action:

- "Prisma reads from the system's environment when looking for environment variables..."

### Be assertive

Use assertive language.

Good:

- Use the `createMany` method to create multiple records in a single transaction
- You can use nested writes to create a user and that user's posts at the same time

Avoid:

- This example tries to..
- You might be able to..
- You could use..

Assertive language in procedures:

Good:

- Install dotenv-cli

Avoid:

- Please install dotenv-cli

### Use clear hyperlinks

Hyperlinks should contain the clearest words to indicate where the link will lead you.

```md
<!-- Good -->

Read more in the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)

<!-- Bad -->

Read more in the Prisma docs [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)
```

### Be specific when using version numbers

When you are writing about a specific version, be sure to specifiy _ to what product_ you are referring. For example, in the following sentence it might be unclear to users whether version 3.11.1 refers to Prisma or to MongoDB:

_This filter is available on MongoDB only in versions 3.11.1 and later._

So instead, insert the product name in front of the version number whenever possible.

_This filter is available on MongoDB only in Prisma version 3.11.1 and later._

### In deprecation notices, mention the deprecation version number but not the planned removal version number

When you are explaining that a feature is deprecated, include the version number in which it was deprecated. However, to keep docs lean and accurate, do not mention the version in which Prisma plans to remove the feature.

```md
<!-- Good -->

From v3.0.0, the `command name` command is deprecated.

<!-- Bad -->

From v3.0.0, the `command name` command is deprecated.
We plan to remove `command name` in v.4.0.0.
```

### Indicate when something is optional

When a paragraph or sentence offers an optional path, the beginning of the first sentence should indicate that it’s optional. For example, "if you’d like to learn more about xyz, see our reference guide" is clearer than "Go to the reference guide if you’d like to learn more about xyz."

This method allows people who would not like to learn more about xyz to stop reading the sentence as early as possible. This method also allows people who would like to learn more about xyz to recognize the opportunity to learn quicker instead of accidentally skipping over the paragraph.

### Abbreviate terms

If you want to abbreviate a term in your article, write it out fully first, then put the abbreviation in parentheses. After that, you may use the abbreviation going for the rest of the article. For example, "In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST) is …".

### Avoid ambiguous English words

Avoid the following common words in English, because they can be ambiguous to some readers.

| Word to avoid | Reason to avoid                             | Use instead                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As            | Can mean "because" or "at the same time as" | "Because", or "At the same time" as appropriate                                  |
| May           | Can mean "might" or "is permitted to"       | "Might"                                                                          |
| Should        | Can mean "ought to" or "might happen"       | "Must": "You must rebuild your schema", or <br></br>Omit: "Rebuild your schema." |

## Grammar and formatting

### Capitalize and spell out proper nouns

Although it can be tempting to use abbreviations like "Postgres" (instead of the official proper noun "PostgreSQL") or not worry about casing when writing "Javascript" (instead of "JavaScript"), we're committed to using the preferred notions of proper nouns. A few common examples are:

- Node.js (instead of Node or Node.JS)
- JavaScript and TypeScript (instead of JavaScript and Typescript or JS and TS)
- PostgreSQL (instead of Postgres or Postgresql)
- MongoDB (instead of Mongo)
- GitHub (instead of Github)
- ...

If you're not sure about the spelling of a certain noun, the official homepage of it typically contains the proper spelling for you to look up.

### Titles and headers

- Use sentence casing for titles and headings: only the initial word is uppercase
- Use the present participle form of verbs (add **-ing** - for example: "Configuring the database")
- Do not use punctuation at the end of the phrase unless a question mark is required
- Use `<inlinecode>code</inlinecode>` for code in headings - this is required by navigation elements

### Use tables, bullet lists and numbered lists

Tables and lists are often the most concise way of presenting information. Use the elements whenever they feel appropriate. Here are few guidelines to help decide when to use which:

- Use bullet lists only when the order of the lists doesn't matter (e.g. an enumeration of the features of a database which don't have an inherent order)
- Use numbered lists only when the order of the list matters (e.g. when providing step-by-step instructions where one step builds on the previous)
- Use tables when you're enumerating things that share a number of similar properties/characteristics (e.g. the parameters for an API call which all have a "name", a "type", are required or optional and need a description)

### Use italics and bold font

Italics and bold fonts can be a great way to emphasize certain parts of your sentence to the reader. Use bold font more sparsely and only when you want this part to stand out from the entire paragraph (so that it's visible when a reader only "scans" the page instead of properly reading it). Use italics for words that introduce new concepts for the first time.

### Use inline code format for paths and file names

For example:

- "The generated Prisma Client is located in the `./node_modules/.prisma` folder by default."
- "The `schema.prisma` file is located in..."
- "To use multiple `.env` files..."

### Use inline code format when referring to strings in text

For example:

"The following query returns all records where the `email` field is equal to `Sarah`."

### Make lists clear with the Oxford Comma

Use the Oxford Comma except in titles. It is a comma used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, before "and" or "or" e.g. an Italian painter, sculptor, and architect. It makes things clearer.

[Confusion can happen when you don’t use the Oxford comma.](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-02/22/18/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-32156-1424646300-12.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto)

## Writing code snippets

### Introduce all code snippets

Write a short introductory sentence that:

- Explains what the code snippet is doing
- Links to reference documentation if applicable

For example:

```md
The following [`createMany`](..) query creates several new `User` records:
```

```md
The following [`createMany`](..) query:

- Creates several `User` records
- Creates several nested `Post` records
- Creates several nested `Category` records
```

### Show the result of a query wherever possible

Use the [`<CodeWithResult>`](mdx-examples#code-with-output) component to show a query and the results of that query.

### Use the `highlight` property to highlight

Use the [`highlight` property](mdx-examples#code-block-with-highlighted-code) if you need to highlight your code samples. For example:

````
```prisma highlight=3;normal
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["namedConstraints"]
}
```
````

### Use inline code only when referring to "code concepts"

TBD

### Format code blocks and inline code

Use the following as reference when creating and editing docs: [formatting inline code and code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code).

### Emphasize placeholders

Placeholders are a tricky topic in technical documentation and are one of the most common sources of confusion, especially for beginners. To strive for consistency, placeholders in the Prisma docs are:

- spelled in all-uppercase letters
- prefixed and suffixed with two underscores
- using descriptive terms

As an example, consider the following code block where `__DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL__` is a placeholder for the PostgreSQL connection URL:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "__DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING__"
}
```

Whenever you're using a placeholder, you should make sure that you directly explain or at least link out to another resource that explains how to obtain a value for the placeholder. You should also explicitly call out that this is a placeholder that needs to get replaced with a "real value" including an example of what that real value might look like:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://opnmyfngbknppm:XXX@ec2-46-137-91-216.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/d50rgmkqi2ipus?schema=hello-prisma2"
}
```

### Use prettier code formatting

TBD

### Use expressive variable names

Good:

```ts
const getUsers = (...)
const deleteUsers = (...)
```

Bad:

```ts
const results = (...) // Too generic
const foo = (...) // Too vague
```

### Strive for code snippets to be "valid"

TBD

### Avoid too many inline comments

TBD

### Lists of shell commands

When you need to provide a series of CLI commands as instructions to the reader, don't use a list unless you're providing context for each step:

#### Bad

- `cd path/to/server`
- `docker-compose up -d --build`
- `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate` or `npx sequelize db:migrate`
- `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all` or `npx sequelize db:seed:all`

#### Better

```shell
cd path/to/server
docker-compose up -d --build
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate # or `npx sequelize db:migrate`
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all # or `npx sequelize db:seed:all`
```

or

1. Navigate into the project directory: `cd path/to/server`
1. Start Docker containers: `docker-compose up -d --build`
1. Migrate your database schema: `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate` or `npx sequelize db:migrate`
1. Seed the database: `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all` or `npx sequelize db:seed:all`

### Don't prepend CLI commands with `$`

Use `terminal` for CLI commands - this type of code block includes a `$`:

````
```terminal
npm install prisma
```
````

For example:

```terminal
npm install prisma
```

### npm vs Yarn

Always use `npm` commands instead of `yarn`.

## Spelling

### Hyphens

Hyphens are used according to these [rules](https://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/hyphens.asp).

Sometimes there are some terms where it's not clear whether to use a hyphen or not. In order to strive for consistency, we list those terms here as a rule for using them throughout the Prisma documentation.

#### Spell without hyphen

- Use case
- Command line
- Auto format
- Type safety

#### Spell with hyphen

- Compile-time

#### Spell as one word

- Autocomplete

#### Type-safe and type safe

- "The code is type safe."
- "This is type-safe code."

#### Data source and `datasource`

- The `datasource` block
- "You must regenerate the client when you introduce a new data source"

## Boilerplate

The following section contains frequently used phrases or blocks of content that you can re-use:

### Introducing a preview feature

````md
To enable this feature, add `namedConstraints` to `previewFeatures` in your schema:

```prisma highlight=3;normal
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["namedConstraints"]
}
```
````

### Making recommendations

If it is a Prisma recommendation, use:

> "**We recommend that** you share a single instance of `PrismaClient` across your application."

If it is an industry standard, use:

> "**It is recommended practice to** limit he number of database connections to X."
