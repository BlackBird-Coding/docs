This guide contains guidelines for contributors to the Prisma docs. Our goal is to ensure consistency throughout the Prisma docs and with other official Prisma materials.

> This style guide is heavily inspired by the [Gatsby Style Guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/).

</TopBlock>

## General writing style

### Audience

Write for an audience that has basic software development and database knowledge. Assume that they know how to use their tools, such as their IDE and a terminal window. Many of our users are familiar with advanced concepts and techniques, but we cannot assume this in the docs.

### Simplify

It's a good principal of technical communication to write as simply as possible. This is harder than it sounds, but the extra work is worth it to make clearer, more readable docs. It's particularly important when you write for a global audience, not all of whom are fluent with English.

- Use shorter paragraphs
- Stick to short, simple sentences. Where possible, avoid sentences with multiple clauses.
- English has many synonyms - where possible, choose the simplest word for the job. Examples: "in" instead of "within", "use" instead of "utilize".
- Use lists
- Use examples
- Use bold and emphasis
- Use tables
- Use diagrams

### Tone of voice

Write in a calm, assured tone of voice. Our tone is friendly and direct, but [we don't use slang](#avoid-emojis-slang-and-metaphors).

### Write in US English

US English is the most globally recognized form of English. Use US English punctuation, grammar, and spelling. For example:

- "color" over "colour"
- "behavior" over "behaviour"

### Avoid emojis, slang, and metaphors

Avoid emojis, idiomatic expressions, slang, and metaphors. Prisma has a global community, and the cultural meaning of these items might be different around the world.

### Write in the second person

The second person ("you") gives a conversational tone and speaks directly to the reader. Avoid the first person ("I", "we", "let's", and "us"). Example:

> "You must commit the entire `prisma/migrations` folder to source control."

Exception: Use "we" when you refer to Prisma. For example:

> "We recommend that you share a single instance of `PrismaClient` across your application".

### Use inclusive language

When you refer to one or more people in the third person, use inclusive, gender-neutral language. Use "they/them/their" instead of "he/him/his" or "she/her/her". Avoid gender-specific words like "guys".

### Jargon

> Jargon: (n.) special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand.

The Prisma docs include a lot of technical detail, and jargon is unavoidable. However, we strive to use as little jargon as possible.

When you use jargon, follow these guidelines:

- If you can explain the jargon in a few words, then you might prefer to explain it there and then. Use your judgement to decide what is best for this doc.

- For longer explanations, link to a definition elsewhere.

  - If the jargon is specific to Prisma, then link to a definition in our docs.

  - If the jargon is _not_ specific to Prisma, check if you can find the definition quickly with a web search. If so, then do not explain the term or link to a definition. We can reasonably expect users to know the jargon or to find an explanation for themselves.

- Only link on the first instance of a jargon term in a logical section of the docs.

  A logical section is a section of the docs that we might expect someone to read at one time. Typically, it is a page, or a self-contained section of a page comprising one or more headings.

- When you link to an external definition, choose a credible source. Wikipedia is acceptable, and official third-party documentation is better.

### Use active voice

Use active voice instead of passive voice. It's a more concise and straightforward way to communicate. For example:

- (passive) The `for` loop in JavaScript is used by programmers to…
- (active) Programmers use the `for` loop in JavaScript to…

When our software or third-party does something, state which module or component carries out the action, if this is important to the user.

- "Prisma Client returns all `DateTime` as ISO 8601-formatted strings."

Where the module or component is not important to the user, say that Prisma (or the name of the third-party software) carries out the action:

- "Prisma reads from the system's environment when it looks for environment variables..."

Sometimes you can omit the acting component or module altogether:
“Refer to the generated log file in `/directoryX`.”

### Be assertive

Use assertive language.

Good:

- Use the `createMany` method to create multiple records in a single transaction
- You can use nested writes to create a user and that user's posts at the same time

Avoid:

- This example tries to...
- You might be able to...
- You could use...

Assertive language in procedures:

Good:

- Install dotenv-cli

Avoid:

- Please install dotenv-cli

### Use "that" to clarify sentences

Example: "Ensure that you rebuild your schema.".

See: ["That" as a conjunction for noun clauses](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/formandstyle/writing/grammarmechanics/that).

### Tense

- Write in the [present simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_present) tense.
- Use present simple even when you want to write about something that will happen as the result of a user action: say that the result happens, not that it will happen.

```md
<!-- Good -->

When you run this command, Prisma writes the following log file.

<!-- Bad -->

When you run this command, Prisma will write the following log file.
```

### Indicate when something is optional

When a paragraph or sentence offers an optional path, the beginning of the first sentence should indicate that it’s optional. For example, "if you’d like to learn more about xyz, see our reference guide" is clearer than "Go to the reference guide if you’d like to learn more about xyz."

This method allows people who would not like to learn more about xyz to stop reading the sentence as early as possible. This method also allows people who would like to learn more about xyz to recognize the opportunity to learn quicker instead of accidentally skipping over the paragraph.

## Word choice

### Avoid words like "easy" and "just"

Avoid words like "easy", "just", "simple", and "basic". If users have a hard time completing the task that is supposedly "easy," then they will question their abilities. Consider using more specific descriptors. For example, when you say the phrase "deployment is easy," what do you really mean? Is it easy because it takes fewer steps than another option? If so, use the most specific descriptor possible, which in that case would be "this deployment method involves fewer steps than other options."

For even more inclusive docs, avoid phrases that assume a reader’s experience or skill level, like "just deploy it and you’re done" or "for a refresher (referring to a completely different doc that someone may not have read)". Often, rephrasing results in stronger sentences that work in a wider range of contexts.

### Avoid Latin terms

These are problematic for non-first-language speakers, and can be confusing even to native English speakers.

For example:

- et al (use "and others")
- etc. (use "and so on", or list all of the cases)
- i.e. (use "in other words")
- e.g. (use "such as" or "for example")
- via (use "with" or other equivalent, as in "Now you can start to send queries with the generated Prisma Client API")

### Avoid gerunds ("ing" verb forms)

Avoid gerunds (the "ing" form of verbs). So use "Get started" instead if "Getting started". This applies to both headings and body text.

Examples:

| Avoid                                           | Good                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Test the certificate using a browser            | Test the certificate with a browser       |
| Excluding fields                                | Exclude fields                            |
| If you are using Node.js version 18 or later... | If you use Node.js version 18 or later... |
| You can do this by rebuilding Prisma Client     | To do this, rebuild Prisma Client         |

### Referring to other parts of the docs

Use the following:

- Page
- Section

### Record

Refer to rows in the database as **records**. For example:

"The following `create` query creates a single `User` **record**."

Do not use:

- Entry
- Row
- Object

### Model property

Model property refers to the top-level `PrismaClient` properties that refer to models:

```
const result = await prisma.user.findMany(...) // user model property
const result = await prisma.post.findMany(...) // post model property
```

### Version numbers

- Refer to version numbers as "version x.x.x"
- When you compare version numbers, use "before" and "after", not "lower" and "higher".

```md
<!-- Good -->

This feature is in Preview in versions 3.5.0 and later.

<!-- Bad -->

This feature is in Preview in v3.5.0 and higher.
```

When you are writing about a specific version, be sure to specify _ to what product_ you are referring. For example, in the following sentence it might be unclear to users whether version 3.11.1 refers to Prisma or to MongoDB:

_This filter is available on MongoDB only in versions 3.11.1 and later._

So instead, insert the product name in front of the version number whenever possible.

_This filter is available on MongoDB only in Prisma version 3.11.1 and later._

#### In deprecation notices, mention the deprecation version number but not the planned removal version number

When you explain that a feature is deprecated, include the version number in which it was deprecated. However, to keep docs lean and accurate, do not mention the version in which Prisma plans to remove the feature.

```md
<!-- Good -->

From v3.0.0, the `command name` command is deprecated.

<!-- Bad -->

From v3.0.0, the `command name` command is deprecated.
We plan to remove `command name` in v.4.0.0.
```

### Abbreviate terms

If you want to abbreviate a term, write it out fully first, then put the abbreviation in parentheses. After that, you may use the abbreviation going for the rest of the page. For example, "In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST) is …".

### Avoid ambiguous English words

Avoid the following common words in English, because they are ambiguous to some readers.

| Word to avoid | Reason to avoid                             | Use instead                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As            | Can mean "because" or "at the same time as" | "Because", or "At the same time", as appropriate                                 |
| May           | Can mean "might" or "is permitted to"       | "Might"                                                                          |
| Should        | Can mean "ought to" or "might happen"       | "Must": "You must rebuild your schema", or <br></br>Omit: "Rebuild your schema." |

### Use clear hyperlinks

Avoid the constructions "click here" or "here".

```md
<!-- Good -->

Read more in the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)

<!-- Bad -->

Read more in the Prisma docs [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)
```

If your link text is the title of the destination page, use title case:

```md
<!-- Good -->

For more information, see [Relation queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries).

<!-- Bad -->

For more information, see [Relation Queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries).
```

However, the most concise (and maintainable) way to provide a link to further information is as follows:

```md
[Learn more](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries)
```

## Spelling, punctuation, and formatting

### Avoid contractions

In keeping with our conversational style, some contractions are OK:

- Contractions that include the word not, such as can't, didn't, and doesn't.
- Contractions that include the words is or are. For example: it's and you're.
- However, use contractions sparingly.

For example:

- You're (use "You are")
- It'll (use "It will")

### Avoid exclamation points

In keeping with our calm tone, do not use exclamation points (exclamation marks). Exception: they are acceptable in congratulatory or welcome messages, for example: "Congratulations - you've completed the tutorial!"

### Capitalize and spell out proper nouns

Although you might be tempted to use abbreviations like "Postgres" (instead of the official proper noun "PostgreSQL") or not worry about casing when writing "Javascript" (instead of "JavaScript"), we use the official forms of proper nouns. A few common examples are:

- Node.js (instead of Node or Node.JS)
- JavaScript and TypeScript (instead of JavaScript and Typescript or JS and TS)
- PostgreSQL (instead of Postgres or Postgresql)
- MongoDB (instead of Mongo)
- GitHub (instead of Github)
- ...

If you're not sure about the spelling of a certain noun, check the its official homepage.

### Titles and headers

- Use sentence case for titles and headings: only the initial word is uppercase (exception: capitalize proper nouns)
- [Avoid gerunds](#avoid-gerunds-ing-verb-forms) ("Configure the database", not "Configuring the database")
- Do not use punctuation at the end unless a question mark is required
- Use `<inlinecode>code</inlinecode>` for code in headings - this is required by our navigation elements

### Use tables, bullet lists and numbered lists

Tables and lists are often the most concise way to present information. Use these elements whenever they feel appropriate. Here are few guidelines:

- Use a bullet list when the order of the list doesn't matter (e.g. an enumeration of the features of a database which don't have an inherent order)
- Use a numbered list only when the order of the list matters (e.g. when providing step-by-step instructions where one step builds on the previous)
- Use a table to describe things that share a number of similar properties/characteristics (e.g. the parameters for an API call which all have a "name", a "type", are required or optional and need a description)

### Use italics and bold font

Italics and bold fonts can be a great way to emphasize certain parts of your sentence to the reader. Use bold font more sparsely and only when you want this part to stand out from the entire paragraph (so that it's visible when a reader only "scans" the page instead of properly reading it). Use italics for words that introduce new concepts for the first time.

### Preview and general availability

Use lower case for these. Use capitals when you abbreviate general abbreviation to GA.

```md
<!-- Good -->

We made composite types generally available in version 3.12.0.
They were previously available in preview from version 3.10.0.

<!-- Bad -->

We made composite types Generally Available in version 3.12.0.
They were previously available in Preview from version 3.10.0.
```

### Hyphens

Use hyphens according to these [rules](https://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/hyphens.asp).

Sometimes there are some terms where it's not clear whether to use a hyphen or not. To strive for consistency, we list those terms here.

#### Spell without hyphen

- Use case
- Command line (when referring to it as a noun: "On the command line". Use a hyphen when it's an adjective: "This command-line option...")
- Auto format
- Type safety
- File name
- Compile time (when you use it as a noun: "... at compile time". Use a hyphen when it's an adjective: "This compile-time operation...")

#### Spell as one word

- Autocomplete
- Codebase

#### Type-safe and type safe

- "The code is type safe."
- "This is type-safe code."

#### Data source and `datasource`

- The `datasource` block
- "You must regenerate the client when you introduce a new data source"

### SQL

Say "a SQL query", not "an SQL query". Example: "A SQL database...".

### Files and file types

When you refer to a file or file type, use code format, and include the dot. Use "an" as the preposition if the filename extension, when pronounced, starts with a vowel, otherwise use "a":

- a `.jpg` file
- an `.xls` file
- an `.env` file

Note: when you refer to a specific file, use the capitalization in the file name:

- the `schema.prisma` file

#### Special case: JSON

- When you refer to JSON in general, use all caps and no code format
- When you refer to the Prisma `Json` API, use `Json`
- When you refer to a JSON file, use the formatting rules above: "a `.json` file"

### Prisma product names

Use the following forms:

- The Prisma Data Platform
- Prisma Client (not any variation of "the Client")
- Prisma Schema
- Prisma Migrate
- Prisma CLI
- Prisma Studio

### Use inline code format for paths and file names

For example:

- "The generated Prisma Client is located in the `./node_modules/.prisma` folder by default."
- "The `schema.prisma` file is located in..."
- "To use multiple `.env` files..."

### Use inline code format when referring to strings in text

For example:

"The following query returns all records where the `email` field is equal to `Sarah`."

### Avoid excessive code formatting

Documents can quickly get visually cluttered if they have too much special formatting. Our docs are highly technical, and we often refer to code snippets or technical keywords that appear in the user's code. For these keywords, it's appropriate for us to use code formatting. However, we should not refer to general technologies (such as JSON) with code formatting:

For example:

Prisma automatically converts JavaScript objects (for example, `{ extendedPetsData: "none"}`) to JSON.

### Make lists clear with the Oxford Comma

Use the Oxford Comma except in titles. It is a comma used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, before "and" or "or" e.g. an Italian painter, sculptor, and architect. It makes things clearer.

[Confusion can happen when you don’t use the Oxford comma.](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-02/22/18/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-32156-1424646300-12.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto)

### Code snippets

#### Introduce all code snippets

Write a short introductory sentence that:

- Explains what the code snippet is doing
- Links to reference documentation if applicable

For example:

```md
The following [`createMany`](..) query creates several new `User` records:
```

```md
The following [`createMany`](..) query:

- Creates several `User` records
- Creates several nested `Post` records
- Creates several nested `Category` records
```

#### Show the result of a query wherever possible

Use the [`<CodeWithResult>`](mdx-examples#code-with-output) component to show a query and the results of that query.

#### Use the `highlight` property to highlight

Use the [`highlight` property](mdx-examples#code-block-with-highlighted-code) if you need to highlight your code samples. For example:

````
```prisma highlight=3;normal
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["namedConstraints"]
}
```
````

#### Use inline code only when referring to "code concepts"

TBD

#### Format code blocks and inline code

Use the following as reference when creating and editing docs: [formatting inline code and code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code).

#### Emphasize placeholders

Placeholders are a tricky topic in technical documentation and are one of the most common sources of confusion, especially for beginners. To strive for consistency, placeholders in the Prisma docs:

- are spelled in all-uppercase letters
- are prefixed and suffixed with two underscores
- use descriptive terms

As an example, consider the following code block where `__DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL__` is a placeholder for the PostgreSQL connection URL:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "__DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING__"
}
```

Whenever you use a placeholder, explain how to obtain a value for the placeholder, or link to another resource that explains this. Explicitly call out that this is a placeholder that must be replaced with a "real value". Include an example of what that real value might look like:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://opnmyfngbknppm:XXX@ec2-46-137-91-216.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5432/d50rgmkqi2ipus?schema=hello-prisma2"
}
```

#### Use prettier code formatting

TBD

#### Use expressive variable names

Good:

```ts
const getUsers = (...)
const deleteUsers = (...)
```

Bad:

```ts
const results = (...) // Too generic
const foo = (...) // Too vague
```

#### Strive for code snippets to be "valid"

TBD

#### Avoid too many inline comments

TBD

#### Lists of shell commands

When you need to provide a series of CLI commands as instructions to the reader, use a single block. Don't use a list unless you want to provide context for each step:

##### Bad

- `cd path/to/server`
- `docker-compose up -d --build`
- `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate` or `npx sequelize db:migrate`
- `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all` or `npx sequelize db:seed:all`

##### Better

```shell
cd path/to/server
docker-compose up -d --build
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate # or `npx sequelize db:migrate`
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all # or `npx sequelize db:seed:all`
```

or

1. Navigate into the project directory: `cd path/to/server`
1. Start Docker containers: `docker-compose up -d --build`
1. Migrate your database schema: `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate` or `npx sequelize db:migrate`
1. Seed the database: `./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all` or `npx sequelize db:seed:all`

### Don't prepend CLI commands with `$`

Use `terminal` for CLI commands - this type of code block includes a `$`:

````
```terminal
npm install prisma
```
````

For example:

```terminal
npm install prisma
```

#### npm vs Yarn

Always use `npm` commands instead of `yarn`.

#### Terminal window

Use the term "terminal window", not another term such as "command prompt" or "shell". Example:

```
Open a terminal window.
```

## Boilerplate

The following section contains frequently used phrases or blocks of content that you can re-use:

### To introduce a preview feature

````md
To enable this feature, add `namedConstraints` to `previewFeatures` in your schema:

```prisma highlight=3;normal
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["namedConstraints"]
}
```
````

### Making recommendations

If it is a Prisma recommendation, use:

> "**We recommend that** you share a single instance of `PrismaClient` across your application."

If it is an industry standard, use:

> "**It is recommended practice to** limit the number of database connections to X."
