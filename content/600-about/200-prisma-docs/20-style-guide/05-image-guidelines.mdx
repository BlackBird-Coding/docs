## Guidelines TBA

To be written up:

For screenshots:

- Use SnagIt ðŸ™‚
- Always save the SnagIt Project file along with the PNG (latest version filename extension is `.sngx`)
- Save the screenshot as a PNG
- Where to put the source file
- Where to put the PNG file
- Always apply a centered minimum shadow. How? TBW. Why? Because modern UIs are predominantly white and if thereâ€™s no shadow, screenshots just blend in
- What about community members who don't have SnagIt?

For diagrams:

- Use Figma
- Base on existing diagram, so that we have the same styling
- In the diagram, link to the diagram's Figma source file. Figma, as a comment in the Markdown source. (add example of this here)
- What about users who don't have access to Figma?

# Image annotations

To be written up:

- Text (do we want to avoid text in images, and use numbers with keys below them?)
- Arrows
- White highlight of text and shadows
