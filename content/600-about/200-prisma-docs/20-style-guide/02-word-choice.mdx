## Avoid words like "easy" and "just"

Avoid words like "easy", "just", "simple", and "basic". If users have a hard time completing the task that is supposedly "easy," then they will question their abilities. Consider using more specific descriptors. For example, when you say the phrase "deployment is easy," what do you really mean? Is it easy because it takes fewer steps than another option? If so, use the most specific descriptor possible, which in that case would be "this deployment method involves fewer steps than other options."

For even more inclusive docs, avoid phrases that assume a reader’s experience or skill level, like "just deploy it and you’re done" or "for a refresher (referring to a completely different doc that someone may not have read)". Often, rephrasing results in stronger sentences that work in a wider range of contexts.

## Avoid Latin terms

These are problematic for non-first-language speakers, and can be confusing even to native English speakers.

For example:

- et al (use "and others")
- etc. (use "and so on", or list all of the cases)
- i.e. (use "in other words")
- e.g. (use "such as" or "for example")
- via (use "with" or other equivalent, as in "Now you can start to send queries with the generated Prisma Client API")

## Avoid gerunds ("ing" verb forms)

Avoid gerunds (the "ing" form of verbs). For example, use "Get started" instead if "Getting started". This guideline applies to both headings and body text.

Examples:

| Avoid                                           | Good                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Test the certificate using a browser            | Test the certificate with a browser       |
| Excluding fields                                | Exclude fields                            |
| If you are using Node.js version 18 or later... | If you use Node.js version 18 or later... |
| You can do this by rebuilding Prisma Client     | To do this, rebuild Prisma Client         |

Note that nouns ending in "ing" are fine - for example "heading".

## Avoid incomplete sentences before lists

When you introduce a list, do not use an incomplete sentence.

### Use

You can do the following:

- Item 1
- Item 2

### Avoid

You can:

- Item 1
- Item 2

## Referring to other parts of the docs

Use the following:

- Page
- Section

## Record

Refer to rows in the database as **records**. For example:

"The following `create` query creates a single `User` **record**."

Do not use:

- Entry
- Row
- Object

## Model property

Model property refers to the top-level `PrismaClient` properties that refer to models:

```

const result = await prisma.user.findMany(...) // user model property
const result = await prisma.post.findMany(...) // post model property

```

## Version numbers

- Refer to version numbers as "version x.x.x"
- When you compare version numbers, use "before" and "after", not "lower" and "higher".

```md
<!-- Good -->

This feature is in Preview in versions 3.5.0 and later.

<!-- Bad -->

This feature is in Preview in v3.5.0 and higher.
```

When you are writing about a specific version, be sure to specify _ to what product_ you are referring. For example, in the following sentence it might be unclear to users whether version 3.11.1 refers to Prisma or to MongoDB:

_This filter is available on MongoDB only in versions 3.11.1 and later._

So instead, insert the product name in front of the version number whenever possible.

_This filter is available on MongoDB only in Prisma version 3.11.1 and later._

### In deprecation notices, mention the deprecation version number but not the planned removal version number

When you explain that a feature is deprecated, include the version number in which it was deprecated. However, to keep docs lean and accurate, do not mention the version in which Prisma plans to remove the feature.

```md
<!-- Good -->

From v3.0.0, the `command name` command is deprecated.

<!-- Bad -->

From v3.0.0, the `command name` command is deprecated.
We plan to remove `command name` in v.4.0.0.
```

## Abbreviate terms

If you want to abbreviate a term, write it out fully first, then put the abbreviation in parentheses. After that, you may use the abbreviation going for the rest of the page. For example, "In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST) is …".

## Avoid ambiguous English words

Avoid the following common words in English, because they are ambiguous to some readers.

| Word to avoid             | Reason to avoid                               | Use instead                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| As                        | Can mean "because" or "at the same time as"   | "Because", or "At the same time", as appropriate                                                       |
| Since (to mean "because") | Can mean "after" (as in "since you upgraded") | "Because"                                                                                              |
| May                       | Can mean "might" or "is permitted to"         | "Might"                                                                                                |
| Should                    | Can mean "ought to" or "might happen"         | "Must": "You must rebuild your schema", or <br></br>Omit: "Rebuild your schema."                       |
| Should                    | Can mean "ought to" or "might happen"         | "Must": "You must rebuild Prisma Client", or <br></br>Omit where appropriate: "Rebuild Prisma Client." |

## Use clear hyperlinks

Avoid the constructions "click here" or "here", because they are considered bad practice on the web.

```md
<!-- Good -->

Read more in the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)

<!-- Bad -->

Read more in the Prisma docs [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)
```

If your link text is the title of the destination page, use title case:

```md
<!-- Good -->

For more information, see [Relation queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries).

<!-- Bad -->

For more information, see [Relation Queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries).
```

However, when it is obvious what the link destination is, a very concise (and maintainable) way to provide a link to further information is as follows:

```md
[Learn more](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries)
```

## Specific terms

### "Preview" and "general availability"

Use lower case for these. For "GA", the abbreviation of general availability, use all caps.

```md
<!-- Good -->

We made composite types generally available in version 3.12.0.
They were previously available in preview from version 3.10.0.

<!-- Bad -->

We made composite types Generally Available in version 3.12.0.
They were previously available in Preview from version 3.10.0.
```

### SQL

Say "a SQL query", not "an SQL query". Example: "A SQL database...".

### Prisma product names

Use the following forms:

- The Prisma Data Platform (or PDP after first mention)
- Prisma Client (not any variation of "the Client")
- Prisma Schema
- Prisma Migrate
- Prisma CLI
- Prisma Studio

Do not abbreviate these names, except where noted above.

### Terminal window

Use the term "terminal window", not another term such as "command prompt" or "shell". Example:

```
Open a terminal window.
```
